                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    The vision I have for this website is a personal fitness tracker and journal.
                    I want a goal list (Todo App), the current weather (Weather API), Achievement 
                    Page (Gallery w/ CSS effects and utilizing a JSON File), a support system page 
                    with a contact info form and list the user can build as well as links to mental, 
                    emotional, and physical support programs, a banner with a new motivational quote 
                    each day, and a last visited date (Local Storage). There will be a meal planner
                    page with a form with days of the week. On the main page, I will have a form for
                    the user to add before front and side view pictures with placeholders. 
                </p>

                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    The focus of this website is rather broad, although the main user base I see as 
                    being 16+ years of age. Anyone who is interested in tracking their progress and 
                    fitness should find this site useful. Parents can use it in support of children,
                    Adults for their personal use or a support for a friend, etc.   
                </p>

                <ul class="data">
                    <li>
                        At least one API. I would like to have two, a weather API and a fitness API, 
                        although I will have to researh that
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        A JSON file for the Achievements page. I like using JSON for lists that need 
                        to be updated regularly. It makes for a nice organized format.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        I will be using Local Storage to show the last visited date as a motivator.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        srcset will be used for pictures to maintain responsiveness. 
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        There may be additions to the Data Types as I develop the site over the 
                        next few weeks.

                    before and after, transition, and there will be color changes on click events. 
                    There will be placeholders for images and lazy loading to improve page 
                    performance and responsiveness.
