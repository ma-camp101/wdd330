        <h1>Week 7 Notes and Activities</h1>
        <p><strong>I started going back and doing the practice activities again.</strong> I only got the first one finished. This week has been busy.</p><br>
        <a class="activities" href="practice.html">Practice</a><br><br>
        <p><strong>The group met on Thursday.</strong>I rescheduled to be able to make your Zoom. A couple guys were not able to make the group meeting due to other committments that night, but I sent them notes and the code. We discussed meetings going forward and came to the conclussion that we need to have the group activity done, or mostly done, beforehand so that the driver has time to walk us through it. Trying to do the activity in an hour is no longer feasable with how much needs doing.</p>
        <p><strong>Rombie again came up with the final JavaScript.</strong> He really knows how to get results. I am much more comfortable in CSS, and I have been doing all of the CSS for the Activity. I do some trouble-shooting to make everything mesh, but the core JavaScript is his.</p><br>
        <a class="activities" href="group/index.html">Group Activity</a><br><br>
        <p><strong>As I said, we will work on the activity earlier in the week.</strong> I feel that should take a lot of pressure of the Driver of the Week. It will help me focus on getting better at the JavaScript at the same time.</p>
