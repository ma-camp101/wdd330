    <h1>Notes and Activities</h1>
    <p>I went through the Quiz Ninja program. I have to say that I would rather build it without using alert and instead display it as a list or a text field. Alert is just annoying. My Quiz Ninja is currently just a visual example of what I mean and not a working example. I will spend time on it this weekend to make it a working program.</p>

    <p>My group met on Wednesday. Surprisingly, everyone showed up. Two never responded to my messages, so I wasn't sure if they would. Everyone participated and we worked through the group activity together. It went really well and I am once again blessed with a great group. I have yet to have a bad one since starting the Pathways program.</p>
    <p>Rather than a question this week, I will make a statement. I am not at all satisfied with my skills in JavaScript. I am going to start practicing it every day to get fluent in its use, because I struggled with the sandbox activities as well as the group activity.</p>
