        <h1>Week 4 Notes and Activities</h1>
        <p><strong>These past two weeks I had COVID and really struggled to get my work done.</strong> I mostly just slept for much of the time. Fortunately, I have been able to get at least the bare minimum done.</p>
        <p><strong>I am feeling better and hope to do some extra reading and practice this coming week to make up for the lost time.</strong>I am gaining more confidence in my JavaScript, but still need to keep at it. I find it slips away when I don't put in the practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Our group activity went great again this week.</strong> Cory couldn't join us because of family responsibilities, so I sent him a copy of the code along with some notes. It's tough with a group from some many timezones to meet at a good time for everyone, but I think we are doing really well, all things considered.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Where can I find a comprehensize list of JavaScript problems that interviewers are likely to ask me to solve?</strong> I really tripped up on those couple problems we have had so far and I want to practice, not just to pass interview tests, but to gain real understanding and problem solving skills.</p>
