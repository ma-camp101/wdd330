        <h1>Week 4 Notes and Activities</h1>
        <p><strong>I really enjoyed the reading this week.</strong> I am going to go back and reread chapters 12 and 15. I have worked with forms before, so I feel confident I understood that chapter. I understood the concepts in the other two chapters, but going back over it will help.</p>
        <p><strong>The issue caused by Bootstrap threw me for a couple days.</strong>I am glad we got it worked out. I should have just made a separate repo for that class in the first place. I now have to reinstall Bootstrap and I think it will get its own repo too so I can avoid that same problem with the other classes repo.</p>
        <p><strong>Our group activity went great again this week.</strong> Tommy drove this week and did a great job. We reach the core goals and the first stretch, but had some difficulty when it came to the logic. After we went over the teachers example, we called it. Tommy kept at it and sent us the fixed code. There are still one or two small sticky points, but he got it way further than I would have without a lot of help.</p><br>

        <p><strong>I had no trouble building the board, but hit a wall when it came to the rest.</strong> Frankly, Tommy's code and the speed with which he put it together blew me away. I hope to be that good some day.ðŸ˜…</p>
