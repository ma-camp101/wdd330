    <p>Figured out the sitepoint.com discount code issue. For some reason, they have the code on a piece of paper
         in an envelope instead of in a file on the computer. This requires someone to physically get that piece 
         of paper, scan it, and then email the picture to the student. Because of how their site is set up, they 
         require shipping information. Then, if it is just a code, they refund the shipping cost when they email 
         the code. A very backwards system!</p>
    <p>Brother James helped me get my JavaScript working. I had deleted an important line of code mistakenly.</p>
    <p>Is there a dedicated Advanced JavaScript class available? I neeed as much practice in that area as I can
         get. I really enjoyed CIT 160.</p>
