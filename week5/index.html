        <h1>Week 5 Notes and Activities</h1>
        <p><strong>Before I got COVID I said I would work on improving by doing daily JavaScript exercises.</strong> That went out the window as I dealt with the fatigue and just trying to keep up with classes. Starting today I am going to pledge to myself to begin that effort. I was the driver for the group this week, and despite starting to work on the group project a couple days ahead, I still had not figured out the solution to everything by the time our group met on Wednesday. This has to change.</p>
        <p><strong>Debugging and Verification are part of the coders life, I am finding.</strong>It shows in how many tools are available to make it easier to find errors and correct sloppy code. The reading this week was both review and gave me a couple of new tools for the toolbox. I had not heard of Jest before.</p>
        <p><strong>Rombie to the rescue.</strong> The group meeting did not go well. Everyone showed up, but we were unable to resolve the stretch goals by the end. I was going to continue working on it the next morning. Just after I sat down to start, Rombie posted his solution on my Discord. With one minor correction, and the styling I contributed, it ran great.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Before our meeting, I had done the CSS so that we could focus on the JavaScript.</strong> I feel more and more that I fall into the Designer catagory. I am more comfortable there. That does not change the fact that I want to be at least proficient at the other aspects of Web Development. JavaScript is a vital part of that equation. I loved CIT 160. Unfortunately, there was less focus on JavaScript in WDD 230, and I lost the edge I had in the previous class. I need to make up for that now.</p>
