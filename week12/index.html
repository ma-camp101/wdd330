        <h1>Week 12-14 Notes and Project</h1>
        <p><strong>For the last group meeting, it was just Rombie and me.</strong> As we both 
            had a good idea of what we were doing for our projects, we didn't meet for very
            long. I had hoped that more would show up for the last meeting, but it is what it is.</p><br>
        <p><strong>I spent a few weeks building up my project, only to realize there was not enough
            meat to each page to justify multiple pages, so I cut it down.</strong> It pretty much 
            brought me down to the wire, as I still had some trouble-shooting to do. Still, I am
            happy with the results.</p><br>
