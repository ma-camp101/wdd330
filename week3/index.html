    <p><strong>These past two weeks I had COVID and really struggled to get my work done.</strong> I mostly just slept for much of the time. Fortunately, I have been able to get at least the bare minimum done.</p>

    <p><strong>The code used for the lightbox effect is adapted from this <a class="codepen" href="https://codepen.io/ongtiffany/pen/BoOeQV"><i>Codepen</i></a> by <a class="codepen" href="https://codepen.io/ongtiffany">Tiffany Ong</a></strong></p>
    <p><strong>I am feeling better and hope to do some extra reading and practice this coming week to make up for the lost time.</strong>I am gaining more confidence in my JavaScript, but still need to keep at it. I find it slips away when I don't put in the practice.</p><br>

    <p><strong>Where can I find a comprehensize list of JavaScript problems that interviewers are likely to ask me to solve?</strong> I really tripped up on those couple problems we have had so far and I want to practice, not just to pass interview tests, but to gain real understanding and problem solving skills.</p>
