        <h1>Week 9 Notes, Activities, Project, and Project Proposal</h1>
        <p><strong>Rombie, Tommy, and I met and worked through the Group activity.</strong> 
            Cory usually makes it, but couldn't this week. I haven't heard from Jucinaldo for 
            a few weeks now. I message everyone each week ahead of the meeting and send out the 
            finished code for everyone, but do not get much feedback.</p><br>

        <p><strong>I knew that the proposal would take a while, so I set Thursday aside for 
            it.</strong> I ended up building the basic structure and a few features of the 
            project to flesh ideas out for the proposal.</p><br>
            <a class="activities" href="project/index.html">Project</a><br><br>
        <p><strong>I enjoyed working on the proposal.</strong> It reminded me why I enjoy web 
            design. I spent the whole day coming up with ideas and typing them in, building 
            sections of the proposal. I cannot help but try and make things look nice.</p><br>

        <p><strong>I am not 100% on my understanding of modules.</strong> I have used them
            and will work on this over the next few weeks to increase my understanding.</p>
