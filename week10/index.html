        <h1>Week 10 Notes, Activities, and Project</h1>
        <p><strong>We almost had the whole group this week.</strong> I wa the driver this 
            week and the only group member missing was Jucinaldo. We all had trouble with
            this activity, but it wasn't the problem we thought it was. There are very few
            earthquakes in my area, so the program had nothing to return. We only figured
            this out when Rombie tested the code after the meeting. It worked fine for him as 
            there are lots of earthquakes where he is.</p><br>

        <p><strong>I had hoped to go back and work on the stretch goals, but this has been
            a busy week.</strong> I will try this weekend when I have all the work for my other
            classes out of the way. I have some ideas about using some functions similar to those
            in the hikes activity for the full details view.</p><br>

            <p><strong>I changed up my schedule slightly for the project.</strong> I went 
            ahead and put in all of the HTML I could think of so that I can focus on just the 
            JavaScript starting this next week. I will probably have to add some more in later,
            but the bulk of the HTML should be finished.</p><br>
