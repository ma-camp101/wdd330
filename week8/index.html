        <h1>Week 8 Notes and Activities</h1>
        <p><strong>CSS is where I am most comfortable, so going over those chapters was fun.</strong> I have used transitions and transforms and SVG, but not canvas or drag-and-drop. I played with the last a couple times, but need to spend more time to get it right.</p>
        <p><strong>In looking ahead, I saw projects are just a week away, so I will be working on a plan for that.</strong> I aminterested in bringing all we have learned together in one site or page.</p>
        <p><strong>Rombie really gets this class.</strong> I can figure things out, but it takes a while. He seems much more able to find solutions and implement them. He was the scheduled driver this week and once again he did a great job. He handled both the Javascript and the CSS this time.</p><br>
